			I am a Graduate student at Northeastern University intrigued by data power and looking forward for a change in career path into the field of Data Sciecne.
			The application is developed from my current understanding of data pre-processing, analytics and data sciecne just to get a hold of all these concepts!

			With the advancement in different technologies Machine Learning is slowly getting involved in every possible domain and so is in the music industry.
			Our objective behind building moodtunes is to deteremine the mood of any hindi/english song as happy or sad by using machine learning techniques and performing sentiment analysis on lyrics.
			The application is constructed such that it could identify the mood with the help of a Logistic Regression classifier which is Hypertunned for better performance.
